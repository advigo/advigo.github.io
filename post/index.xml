&lt;h1 id=&#34;use-your-iphone-or-ipad-to-charge-creditcards&#34;&gt;Use your iphone or ipad to charge creditcards.&lt;/h1&gt;

There has been a lot about it, but feels like it is ripe now to be established on a broad front. Since it has no fixed monthly fees or entry fees so it seems perfect for small business owners.&lt;/p&gt;
